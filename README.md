# API_Assignment4 - Creating My Own API 
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
This is a project is the process to understant how to create my own API for a simple voting system. The person would click over their favorite animal, and after clicked over the image, the website would show how many clicks that animal recieve before. 

In this website, I am only putting only one option of voting for a specific cat. The idea is to have a voting system were the person choose an animal and then were tell them how many votes has each animal.

<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->

<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup
To setup the project you need access to a computer and the internet. 
To be able to see the website you can go to [Glitch Website](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/themiscadiz-assignment4?path=app.js:12:0)

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are necessary:

A text editor - like VS Code
Terminal or Command line.

<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
## Installation
You need the express, path, fs library  from npm

<!-- Notes about the deployment -->
## Deployment

To locally host your website (in case of Mac):

1. Download the Code to your computer.
2. Open the Terminal
3. Type cd (donâ€™t forget the space)
4. In Finder, navigate to the folder and Drag and drop into the Terminal.
5. Type <pre><code>npm start</code>
6. Server should launch, and you should see the correct ip address to navigate to. Something like this: **localhost:3000**  

**Notes:** There a other ways to open a localhost. This is just my prefered method, because it automatically refreshes the website.

## Built with
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Github](https://github.com)

# Notes & Process
For this assigment I start watching a lot of videos and reading the class material to trying to understant what are the concepts that we were trying to understant and use for this week. Although that I was able to in a very basic way create an API and save the information into a json file, just to make it works was really challenging. This assignment had a lot of new concepts of programming for the web, a lot new use in the terminal, what create a confusing path around the assignment.

The original goal was to create a voting system, where a person can vote for its favorite animal. After vote the person can see what are the votes that each animal has.

While I was undestanding and struggle through the process, I simplified the concept into just to vote for one animal (in this case the cat) and see how many vote has the cat accumulate.

In this way I was apble to concentrate into achieve to request the data from the JSON file, update the JSON File and update the information in the website.

### Understanding Node.js
While more I was reading I started notice that what I was planning to used

At first I was planing and starting to use the Horoscope.js npm. But while I was diving into the material, I noticed that i wasn't going to be able to explore the fundamentals concepts of this assignment.

I started this assignment following the Fondations Guide from the class. Iwas able to  understant how to interact with node through the terminal. However when I tried to started the assignment I wasnt able to see what I was trying to do. I needed help understanding how we interact with node js, it is not the typical way as js.... more like a invisible, backend and that was I was only able to seeit running in the terminal. Not as a console log on the browser.

### Designing the website

### Creating an API


### Accesing the API


### JSON database


### Deploying to Glitch




## Challenges & Struggles
1. Start to understand the nature of backend.
1. Creating an interactive button
2. Accesing the API data
3. Understanding how to use: Deployment of website in Glitch
