# API_Assignment4 - Creating My Own API 
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
This is a project is the process to understant how to create my own API for a simple voting system. The person would click over their favorite animal, and after clicked over the image, the website would show how many clicks that animal recieve before. 

In this website, I am only putting only one option of voting for a specific cat. The idea is to have a voting system were the person choose an animal and then were tell them how many votes has each animal.

<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->

<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup
To setup the project you need access to a computer and the internet. 
To be able to see the website you can go to [Glitch Website](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/themiscadiz-assignment4?path=app.js:12:0)

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are necessary:

A text editor - like VS Code
Terminal or Command line.

<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
## Installation
You need the express, path, fs library  from npm

<!-- Notes about the deployment -->
## Deployment

To locally host your website (in case of Mac):

1. Download the Code to your computer.
2. Open the Terminal
3. Type cd (donâ€™t forget the space)
4. In Finder, navigate to the folder and Drag and drop into the Terminal.
5. Type <pre><code>npm start</code>
6. Server should launch, and you should see the correct ip address to navigate to. Something like this: **localhost:3000**  

**Notes:** There a other ways to open a localhost. This is just my prefered method, because it automatically refreshes the website.
